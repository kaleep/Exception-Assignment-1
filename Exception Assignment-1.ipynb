    "Q.1. what is an exception in python? write the difference between exception and syntax errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:\n",
    "In Python, an exception is an event that occurs during the execution of a program, which disrupts the normal flow of the program's instructions. When an exceptional situation arises, Python raises an exception, which can be caught and handled by the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "Exceptions can occur due to various reasons, such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "Errors in program logic or calculations.\n",
    "External factors like input/output operations or network connectivity.\n",
    "Resource constraints like memory or disk space issues.\n",
    "Operating system errors or other system-level issues.\n",
    "When an exception is raised and not properly handled, it results in the termination of the program and displays an error message. However, Python provides mechanisms to catch and handle exceptions, allowing developers to gracefully deal with errors and control the program flow.\n",
    "\n",
    "Syntax errors, on the other hand, are errors that occur due to incorrect syntax or grammar in the code. They are detected by the Python interpreter during the parsing phase before the program is executed. Syntax errors prevent the program from running and must be fixed before the code can be executed successfully.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are the key differences between exceptions and syntax errors:\n",
    "\n",
    "Occurrence: Exceptions occur during the execution of a program when an error or exceptional situation arises. Syntax errors occur during the parsing phase, even before the program starts executing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Detection: Exceptions are detected at runtime when the exceptional condition occurs. Syntax errors are detected by the Python interpreter before runtime, during the parsing phase.\n",
    "\n",
    "Handling: Exceptions can be caught and handled using try-except blocks, allowing the program to gracefully handle errors and continue execution. Syntax errors need to be fixed in the code before the program can be executed successfully.\n",
    "\n",
    "Impact: Exceptions disrupt the normal flow of the program but can be handled to prevent program termination. Syntax errors prevent the program from running altogether until they are fixed."

    "You may need custom exceptions for the following reasons:\n",

    "Specific Error Handling: Custom exceptions help you differentiate between different types of errors or exceptional situations in your code. By creating custom exception classes, you can provide more specific error messages and handle those exceptions separately.\n",
